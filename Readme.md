Introduction
In this project, we will evaluate the King County housing data set and try to predict housing prices with a linear regression model.

Objectives
Model King County housing dataset to predict housing prices
Describe which features are most predictive of price
Explore any other nuances in the data
Explore which features give you the best deal.
1. Explore and Clean the Data
In this section we will place all import statements then clean the data.We'll check out scatterplot and histograms for irregularities / outliers and remove as necessary. Then we'll separate categorical and continuous data.

2. Categorical Data
Categorical data will get dummy variables

3.Feature Scaling

4. Create Models
Use the selection techniques to select variables and then actually use them in the models.

5. Interpret the model
Use the model to answer our objectives. First we'll print out the final model coefficients and create a visualization to show which terms / features were the most import.
